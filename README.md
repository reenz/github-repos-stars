# Stars in GitHub Public Repositories 

This app will find out how many stars a GitHub user has across all their public repositories. 

I will use:

* `GitHub API` to get information about all the user's repositories
* `NodeJs` to handle the HTTP requests and compute the total stars
* `redis` as a caching layer to speed things up!
